Fix for Render.com
Option 1: Add a build command in Render Dashboard (Recommended)

Go to your Render dashboard
Select your web service
Go to Settings
Find Build Command and set it to:
bash
   composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
Save changes and redeploy
Option 2: Create a render.yaml file in your project root:

render.yaml - Render Configuration
Code 
Option 3: Create a build script

Create a file named build.sh in your project root:

bash
#!/bin/bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
Then in Render settings, set Build Command to:

bash
bash build.sh
Verify your project structure
Make sure you have these files in your repository:

your-project/
├── composer.json          ← Must exist
├── composer.lock          ← Should exist (commit it)
├── index.php
├── reset.php
└── .gitignore            ← Should NOT ignore vendor/ on Render
Important: Check your .gitignore file. If it contains vendor/, that's fine for local development, but Render needs to generate it during build.

services:
  - type: web
    name: php-reset-app
    env: php
    buildCommand: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
    startCommand: php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT -t .
    envVars:
      - key: GMAIL_USERNAME
        sync: false
      - key: GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
        sync: false
      - key: APP_URL
        value: https://php-reset-app.onrender.com
